# Improper Input Validation

### Register as a user with administrator privileges

The Juice Shop does not bother to separate administrative functionality
into a deployment unit of its own. Instead, the cheapest solution was
chosen by simply leaving then admin features in the web shop itself and
(allegedly) demanding a higher level of access to use them.

* Register as an ordinary user to learn what API endpoints are involved
  in this use case
* Think of the simplest possible implementations of a distinction
  between regular users and administrators

### Successfully redeem an expired campaign coupon code

Apart from the monthly coupon codes found on Twitter the Juice Shop also
offered some seasonal special campaign at least once.

* Look for clues about the past campaign or holiday event somewhere in
  the application
* Solving this challenge does not require actual time traveling

### Retrieve the photo of Bjoern's cat in "melee combat-mode"

Who wouldn't want to see Bjoern's cat fighting fiercely with a furry
green plush toy?

* When you visit the _Photo Wall_ you will notice a broken image on one of the entries
* You just have to (literally) inspect the problem to understand the basic issue
* It can also help to try out the _Tweet_-button of the entry and observe what happens

### Place an order that makes you rich

It is probably every web shop's nightmare that customers might figure
out away to _receive_ money instead of _paying_ for their purchase.

* You literally need to make the shop owe you any amount of money
* Investigate the shopping basket closely to understand how it prevents
  you from creating orders that would fulfil the challenge

### Follow the DRY principle while registering a user

> The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle states:
> > Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
> > authoritative representation within a system.

* The obvious repetition in the _User Registration_ form is the _Repeat
  Password_ field
* Try to register with either an empty or different value in _Repeat
  Password_
* You can solve this challenge by cleverly interacting with the UI or
  bypassing it altogether

### Upload a file larger than 100 kB

The Juice Shop offers its customers the chance to complain about an
order that left them unsatisfied. One of the juice bottles might have
leaked during transport or maybe the shipment was just two weeks late.
To prove their claim, customers are supposed to attach their order
confirmation document to the online complaint. To prevent abuse of this
functionality, the application only allows file uploads of 100 kB or
less.

* First you should try to understand how the file upload is actually
  handled on the client and server side
* With this understanding you need to find a "weak spot" in the right
  place and have to craft an exploit for it

### Upload a file that has no .pdf or .zip extension

In addition to the maximum file size, the Juice Shop also verifies that
the uploaded file is actually a PDF. All other file types are rejected.

* If you solved the
  [Upload a file larger than 100 kB](#upload-a-file-larger-than-100-kb)
  challenge, you should try to apply the same solution here

### Give a devastating zero-star feedback to the store

You might have realized that it is not possible to submit customer
feedback on the _Contact Us_ screen until you entered a comment and
selected a star rating from 1 to 5. This challenge is about tricking the
application into accepting a feedback with 0 stars.

* Before you invest time bypassing the API, you might want to play
  around with the UI a bit
