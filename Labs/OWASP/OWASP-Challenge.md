## Challenge Solutions

In case you are getting frustrated with a particular challenge, you can
refer to the [Challenge solutions](appendix/solutions.md) appendix
where you find explicit instructions how to successfully exploit each
vulnerability. It is highly recommended to use this option only as a
last resort. You will learn __a lot more__ from hacking entirely on your
own or relying only on the hints in this part of the book.
