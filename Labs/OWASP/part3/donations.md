# Donations

As a project of the OWASP Foundation the Juice Shop is and always will
be

* open source
* free software

The entire project is licensed under the liberal
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) which allows even
commercial use and modifications. There will never be an "enterprise" or
"premium" version of OWASP Juice Shop either.

This does not mean that a project like it can thrive without any
funding. Some examples on what the OWASP Juice Shop spent (or might
spend) money on:

* Giveaways for conferences and meetups (e.g.
  [stickers, magnets, iron-ons or temporary tattoos](https://www.stickeryou.com/products/owasp-juice-shop/794))
* Merchandise to reward awesome project contributions or marketing for
  the project (e.g.
  [apparel or mugs](http://shop.spreadshirt.com/juiceshop))
* Bounties on features or fixes (via
  [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/juice-shop))
* Software license costs (e.g. an extended icon library)
* Commercial support where the team lacks expertise (e.g. graphics
  design for this book's cover was paid from donations)
